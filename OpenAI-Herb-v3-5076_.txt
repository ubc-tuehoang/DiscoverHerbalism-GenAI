The image features watercolor illustrations of various plants and herbs, each labeled with a nameâ€”unfortunately, the text appears to be in a script or language that I cannot decipher. However, I can identify the plants and their common uses in herbalism based on their appearance:

1. At the top left, there's a yellow-orange flower that resembles Echinacea. Echinacea is widely used for its potential to boost the immune system and reduce symptoms of colds and other infections.

2. The white flowers next to it with yellow centers look similar to Chamomile. Chamomile is often used in herbal teas for its calming effects and is believed to aid with sleep and digestion.

3. The purple spiky flower appears to be Lavender. Lavender is famed for its calming and relaxing properties. It's often used in aromatherapy, and in teas to reduce stress and anxiety.

4. Below the Lavender, there is a root that looks like Ginger. Ginger is commonly used to alleviate nausea, help with digestion, and as an anti-inflammatory agent.

5. Lastly, the bulbous plant at the bottom right seems to resemble Garlic. Garlic is known for its cardiovascular benefits, as well as its antimicrobial and antiviral properties, and is often used to boost the immune system.

Although the names next to the plants are not in a recognizable script, the images provide a good indication of the plants' identity and their uses within herbal medicine.
